*About the game*

SickBeat is a game we made for our Object-Oriented Programming class. It was
made with Eiffel using the game2 library 
( https://github.com/tioui/eiffel_game_lib ). It doesnt use any sound file, the
sounds are generated by simple algorithms. It uses few images, and the textures
(except for the backgrounds) are also generated.

The goal of the game is to survive with your player by killing ennemies. You
need to move around the map (with WASD) to escape and throw waves at ennemies
(with a mouse click). You can change color to throw waves of different color.
