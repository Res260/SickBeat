About the game
--------------

SickBeat is a game we made for our Object-Oriented Programming class. It was
made with Eiffel using the game2 library 
( https://github.com/tioui/eiffel_game_lib ). It doesnt use any sound file, the
sounds are generated by simple algorithms. It uses few images, and the textures
(except for the backgrounds) are also generated.

The goal of the game is to survive with your player by killing ennemies. You
need to move around the map (with WASD) to escape and throw waves at ennemies
(with a mouse click). You can change color to throw waves of different color.
You damage and get damaged by enemies if you hit or get hit by a different
wave color then the one you or your enemy has.

Installation
------------

You need to have EiffelStudio installed ( https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxr_mpDtxj8MOVFsV1A3MXpKM28 )
and Game2 has well ( https://github.com/tioui/eiffel_game_lib ).

###Windows:

Place every DLL file in the game2 library
( *EiffelRepository*/contrib/library/game2/C_lib_win/DLL32||DLL64/ ) in the 
game folder. Then, open sickbeat.ecf with EiffelStudio and compile the 
finalized version of the program (compile-> Finalize). Discard assertions if 
asked. Then, run the finalized version (run -> run Finalized). Enjoy.


###Linux:
Same as windows, but without the DLLs part.
